# Personality-Map
Hello professors! <br>
This is my final-term project. <br>
It's a mini personality test form, and it shows my ability of using code to make questions, to arrange the interface, and most importantly, it shows my positive attitude towards independent learning.
Please feel free to click on "personality-map.py" or other files to see my code!
